# INST326-Final-Project
# Contact / Address Book Application
We thought about creating an Application that will have all contact information of a certain user and this application that will also hold a database of different contact information. 
We chose to create this application because it will help users to easily access all their contacts' information from one place, instead of having to search through multiple sources such as email, phone contacts, and social media. 

# How to run the Program
This program has two windows: a login window and a contact management application window. To run the program, you need to save the code in a file with a ".py" extension, then run it using a Python interpreter. Here are the steps:

1. Open a code editor such as VS Code or PyCharm, and create a new file.
2. Copy and paste the entire code into the file.
3. Save the file with a name, for example, "contact_manager.py".
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Run the program by typing "python contact_manager.py" in the terminal and press Enter.
6. The login window will appear, and you will be prompted to enter a username and password. Enter "admin" for the username and "password" for the password, then click the "Login" button.
7. If the username and password are correct, the contact management application window will appear. You can use the application to add, view, and delete contacts from a database.
