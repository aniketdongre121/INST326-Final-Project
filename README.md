# INST326-Final-Project
# Contact / Address Book Application
We thought about creating an Application that will have all contact information of a certain user and this application that will also hold a database of different contact information. 
We chose to create this application because it will help users to easily access all their contacts' information from one place, instead of having to search through multiple sources such as email, phone contacts, and social media.
